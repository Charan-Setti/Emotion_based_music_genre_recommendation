Emotion-Based Music Genre Recommendation

This project uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to recommend music genres based on the user's emotional expression captured through a webcam. The application allows users to:
- Select a preferred language to listen to music.
- Choose a singer to generate recommendations linked to their emotion.
- Detect the user's emotion in real-time through facial expressions using OpenCV.
- Predict the dominant emotion (Anger, Neutral, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise) using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- Recommend music genres on YouTube tailored to the user's emotional state, selected singer, and language preference.

The application leverages technologies such as  OpenCV for face detection, Keras for deep learning-based emotion recognition, and web scraping for interactive music genre recommendations on YouTube. Enjoy exploring diverse music genres based on your emotions!
