# Emotion_based_music_genre_recommendation


Emotion-Based Music Genre Recommendation

This project uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to recommend music genres based on the user's emotional expression captured through a webcam. The application allows users to:
- Select a preferred language to listen to music.
- Choose a singer to generate recommendations linked to their emotion.
- Detect the user's emotion in real-time through facial expressions using OpenCV.
- Predict the dominant emotion (Anger, Neutral, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise) using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- Recommend music genres on YouTube tailored to the user's emotional state, selected singer, and language preference.

The application leverages technologies such as  OpenCV for face detection, Keras for deep learning-based emotion recognition, and web scraping for interactive music genre recommendations on YouTube. Enjoy exploring diverse music genres based on your emotions!

I used anaconda for executing this project, so if you have any problems while executing the code here are the steps that my help you:

step1: open anaconda prompt 

step2: now type conda create --name py python=3.8  (this is gonna create an environment named as py and this helps you to execute the application easily everytime)

step3: now type conda activate py (and after activating the environment install all the packages which are required for executing the application) ---And from now you can use this "py" environment whenever you want and it contains all the packages that you have installed---

step4: now provide the path of the code

step5: now use the command 'python code.py' (python space give the file name I gave code because my file name is code)
